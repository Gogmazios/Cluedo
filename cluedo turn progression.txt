SUSPECTS = {S1, S2, S3, S4, S5}
WEAPONS = {W1, W2, W3, W4, W5}
LOCATIONS = {L1, L2, L3, L4, L5}

RANDOMLY CHOSEN SOLUTION: S1, W1, L1 (suspect1, weapon1, location1)

REMAINING CARDS ARE RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG PLAYER AND AIs:
Player:	(S2, W3, W4)
AIanne:	(S3, S4, L2)
AImatt:	(L4, L5, S5)
AIrose:	(L3, W2, W5)
---------------------------

Player's Turn (knows it's not S2, W3, or W4)
	guesses S3, W5, L1
	AIanne reveals (to player only) S3
	AIrose reveals (to player only) W5
	Player now KNOWS that SUSPECT is NOT S2 or S3 (must be S1, S4, S5)
	Player now KNOWS that WEAPON is NOT W3, W4, or W5 (must be W1, W2)
	Player now KNOWS that LOCATION is L1 (nobody else knows this though)
	So... possible combinations ((S1, S4, S5), (W1, W2), (L1))

AIanne's Turn (knows it's not S3, S4, or L2)
	guesses S2, W2, L5
	Player reveals (to AIanne only) S2
	AIrose reveals (to AIanne only) W2
	AImatt reveals (to AIanne only) L5
	AIanne now KNOWS that SUSPECT is NOT S2, S3, S4 (must be S1, S5)
	AIanne now KNOWS that WEAPON is NOT W2 (must be W1, W3, W4, W5)
	AIanne now KNOWS that LOCATION is NOT L2, L5 (must be L1, L3, L4)
	So... possible combinations ((S1, S5), (W1, W3, W4, W5), (L1, L3, L4))
	SMART PLAYER/AI sees ALL THREE being negated, so knows that S2, W2, L5 won't work
	[player possible combinations ((S1, S4, S5), (W1), (L1))]

AImatt's Turn (knows it's not L4, L5, S5, S2, W2)
	guesses S3, W1, L3
	AIanne reveals (to AImatt only) S3
	AIrose reveals (to AImatt only) L3
	AImatt now KNOWS that SUSPECT is NOT S2, S3, S5 (must be S1, S4)
	AImatt now KNOWS that WEAPON MUST BE W1
	AImatt now KNOWS that LOCATION is NOT L3, L4, L5 (must be L1, L2)
	So... possible combinations ((S1, S4), (W1), (L1, L2))

AIrose's Turn (knows it's not L3, W2, W5, S2, L5)
	guesses S5, W3, L4
	Aimatt reveals (to AIrose only) S5 AND L4
	Player reveals (to AIrose only) W3
	AIrose now KNOWS that SUSPECT is NOT S2, S5 (must be S1, S3, S4)
	AIrose now KNOWS that WEAPON is NOT W2, W3 (must be W1, W4, W5)
	AIrose now KNOWS that LOCATION is NOT L3, L4, L5 (must be L1, L2)
	So... possible combinations ((S1, S3, S4), (W1, W4, W5), (L1, L2))
	Player and AIanne don't know that AImatt showed TWO CARDS to AIrose! How exciting...

ROUND TWO POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS
Player => ((S1, S4, S5), (W1), (L1))
AIanne => ((S1, S5), (W1, W3, W4, W5), (L1, L3, L4))
AImatt => ((S1, S4), (W1), (L1, L2))
AIrose => ((S1, S3, S4), (W1, W4, W5), (L1, L2))
Player and AImatt could reasonably guess the solution in the second round.

NOTES:
+ Turn order should be randomized before the game.
+ Games will be quick. Yay.
+ AIs must have unique names, not names of suspects (which would be confusing).
+ AIs could either be all smart or have a range of AI intelligence (would only be worthwhile
if funny dialog, e.g., AIs interacting with each other, otherwise just stick to all smart AIs).
+ AIs could all be smart and only differentiated through dialog styles (easy AND fun). They could
even be based on famous AIs/robots (easy AND fun AND potentially a huge time waster; yay).
+ The entire game could be based on a theme, with suspects, weapons, and locations all
belonging to some franchise or SCCC or whatever.
